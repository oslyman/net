This is site is a collection of thoughts and resources I value. Its aesthetic is inspired by [Motherfucking Website](motherfuckingwebsite.com). It is built with [Hugo](gohugo.io). It is hosted on [Digital Ocean](digitalocean.com). All the content that is mine to relinquish is [uncopyrighted](uncopyright.com). The layout and past revisions of content can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/oslyman/net).
